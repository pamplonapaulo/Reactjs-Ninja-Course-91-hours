    What is React?

    Not a framework, but a library to build User Interfaces

    It's the "V" of Model View Controller

    DOM manipulation:
    
        Webapps
        Mobile Apps
        CMSs

    Don't use React:

        Institutional Websites 
        Blogs

        (Doesn't make sense. It does make sense for more interactive areas)
