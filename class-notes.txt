        Functional Programming

        Setting up environment (development and production)

    
    What is React?

    Not a framework, but a library to build User Interfaces

    It's the "V" of Model View Controller

    DOM manipulation:
    
        Webapps
        Mobile Apps
        CMSs

    Don't use React:

        Institutional Websites 
        Blogs

        (Doesn't make sense. It does make sense for more interactive areas)

    What problems React solve?

        Modularização (separação de responabilidades)

        Componentização (for User Interface)

        Performance (DOM manipulation, virtual DOM)

    Starting a server:
    
        npm i http-server (installing the package)

        http-server (running the server)

        In my case I used:
        
            npx http-server ./
        
        (Using npx you can run the script without installing it first)
